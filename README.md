Sitecore Commerce Wishlist has Plugin that implementes Wishlist for integration with Sitecore Commerce

In e-commerce wishlist or saved products for later purchase if one of the important functionality. So I have created simple plugin in sitecore commerce which will save wishlist product details such as product id, product title, product price in commmerce on customer as component.


This wishlist plugin has implementation of 3 apis
  1. Add Wishlist: To add wishlist to Wishlist Component
  2. Get Wishlist: Gets wishlist from Wishlist Component
